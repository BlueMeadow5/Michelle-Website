<h1>Hi! My name is Michelle!</h1>
  <h2>This the 'About Me' page.</h2>
  <hr>
  <h2>How many years have I been coding?</h2>
  <h3> I have been coding for 2 years, and a month.
  The first two years was when I was 5 to 6 years old while I was learning Python, and then I stopped for around 3 years. The 'month' was when I came back to it around when I was 8, starting off with Python, too, then  in July, learning HTML, CSS, and Java Script.  </h3>
  <h2>What apps do you recommend to learn code?</h2>
  <h3>I recommend Udemy for learning code. Any app, or camp is fine too, in my experience, but in only 3 days, 
 I learned about as much as in a week!</h3>
